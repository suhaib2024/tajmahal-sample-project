    <h1>Taj Mahal</h1>
    <p>
      The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ-/; lit. 'Crown of the Palace') is an
      ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in
      Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth
      Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his beloved
      wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The
      tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes
      a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three
      sides by a crenellated wall. Construction of the mausoleum was completed
      in 1648, but work continued on other phases of the project for another
      five years. The first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by
      Shah Jahan, on 6 February 1643, of the 12th anniversary of the death of
      Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in
      its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹5
      million, which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35 billion (US$77.8
      million). The building complex incorporates the design traditions of
      Indo-Islamic and Mughal architecture. It employs symmetrical constructions
      with the usage of various shapes and symbols. While the mausoleum is
      constructed of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones, red
      sandstone was used for other buildings in the complex similar to the
      Mughal era buildings of the time. The construction project employed more
      than 20,000 workers and artisans under the guidance of a board of
      architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor's court architect. The
      Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being
      "the jewel of Islamic art in India and one of the universally admired
      masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded as one of the best
      examples of Mughal architecture and a symbol of Indian history. The Taj
      Mahal is a major tourist attraction and attracts more than five million
      visitors a year. In 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of
      the World initiative.
